# to-do-list-app

## What could be done with more time
    1. We can create very nice UI
    2. We can sort the items using priority
    3. we can add a backend to store the list instead of static list
    4. we can keep a TO-Do list per user so that each use can have deifferent to-do list also or we can maintain a same to-do list for all the users
    5. We can add select All functionality into it
